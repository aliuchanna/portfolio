                    Building Scoring Program [Based on BluePrint Game]
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a Python application that reads a building structure from a text file, calculates scores based on materials like glass, wood, stone, and recycled materials, and outputs the result into a formatted score report. The project was inspired by the Blueprints game by Z-Man Games and involved creating functions to process building data, apply material-specific scoring rules, and generate accurate results. The program demonstrates proficiency in file handling, list-based data structures, and implementing decision-making algorithms.
